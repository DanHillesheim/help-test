## TL;DR

The following is a summary of the Installation Procedure in this article. Links in this section will jump to detailed **Installation Procedure** sections:

1. [**Configure your Domain**](#configure-your-domain). Set DNS records for a domain name pointing to your machine, and open ports 80 and 443 on the machine.
2. [**Install Docker and Docker Compose**](#install-docker-and-docker-compose) on your machine, and complete the optional [**Docker Post-Installation**](#docker-post-installation-linux-only).
3. Retrieve an installation id and key from [**https://bitwarden.com/host**](https://bitwarden.com/host){:target="_blank"} for use in installation.

   For more information, see [What are my installation id and installation key used for?](https://bitwarden.com/help/article/hosting-faqs/#general).
4. [**Install Bitwarden**](#install-bitwarden) on your machine.
5. [**Configure your Environment**](#configure-your-environment) by adjusting settings in `./bwdata/env/global.override.env`.
   {% callout success %}At a minimum, configure the `globalSettings__mail__smtp...` variables to setup an email server for inviting and verifying users.{% endcallout %}
6. [**Start your instance**](#start-bitwarden).
6. Test your installation by opening your configured domain in a Web Browser.

## Installation Procedure

### Configure your Domain

By default, Bitwarden will be served through ports 80 (`http`) and 443 (`https`) on the host machine. Open these ports so that Bitwarden can be accessed from within and/or outside of the network. You may opt to choose different ports during installation.

{% callout success %}
**If you're using Windows Firewall**, Docker Desktop for Windows will not automatically add an exception for itself in Windows Firewall. Add exceptions for TCP ports 80 and 443 (or chosen alternative ports) to prevent some errors.
{% endcallout %}

Bitwarden recommends configuring a domain name with DNS records that point to your host machine (for example, `bitwarden.example.com`), especially if you are serving Bitwarden over the internet.

### Install Docker and Docker Compose

Bitwarden will be deployed and run on your machine using an array of [Docker containers](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/){:target="_blank"}. Bitwarden can be run with any Docker Edition or plan. Evaluate which edition is best for your installation.

Deployment of containers is orchestrated using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/){:target="_blank"}. Some Docker installations, including Windows and macOS, come with Docker Compose already installed.

**Install Docker and Docker Compose on your machine before proceeding with installation.** Refer to the following Docker documentation for help:

- [Install Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/){:target="_blank"}
- [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/){:target="_blank"}

### Docker Post-Installation (*Linux Only*)

Bitwarden recommends configuring your Linux server with a dedicated `bitwarden` service account, from which to install and run Bitwarden. Doing so will isolate your bitwarden instance from other applications running on your server.

 **These steps are Bitwarden-recommended best practices, but are not required.** For more information, see Docker's [Post-installation steps for Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/){:target="\_blank"} documentation.

1. Create a bitwarden user:

   ```
   sudo adduser bitwarden
   ```
2. Set password for bitwarden user (strong password):

   ```
   sudo passwd bitwarden
   ```
3. Create a docker group (if it doesnâ€™t already exist):

   ```
   sudo groupadd docker
   ```
4. Add the bitwarden user to the docker group:

   ```
   sudo usermod -aG docker bitwarden
   ```
5. Create a bitwarden directory:

   ```
   sudo mkdir /opt/bitwarden
   ```
6. Set permissions for the `/opt/bitwarden` directory:

   ```
   sudo chmod -R 700 /opt/bitwarden
   ```
7. Set the bitwarden user ownership of the `/opt/bitwarden` directory:

   ```
   sudo chown -R bitwarden:bitwarden /opt/bitwarden
   ```

### Install Bitwarden

Bitwarden provides a shell script for easy installation on Linux and macOS (Bash), or Windows (PowerShell). Complete the following steps to install Bitwarden using the shell script:

(*Linux Only*) If you've completed the [Docker Post-Installation](#docker-post-installation) steps, do so as the `bitwarden` user from the `/opt/bitwarden` directory.

1. Download the Bitwarden installation script (`bitwarden.sh`) to your machine:

    {% icon fa-linux %} {% icon fa-apple %} Bash

       curl -Lso bitwarden.sh https://go.btwrdn.co/bw-sh \
           && chmod 700 bitwarden.sh

    {% icon fa-windows %} PowerShell

       Invoke-RestMethod -OutFile bitwarden.ps1 `
           -Uri https://go.btwrdn.co/bw-ps

2. Run the installer script. A `./bwdata` directory will be created relative to the location of `bitwarden.sh`.

    {% icon fa-linux %} {% icon fa-apple %} Bash

       ./bitwarden.sh install

    {% icon fa-windows %} PowerShell

       .\bitwarden.ps1 -install

3. Complete the prompts in the installer:

   - **Enter the domain name for your Bitwarden instance:**

     Typically, this value should be the configured DNS record.
   - **Do you want to use Let's Encrypt to generate a free SSL certificate? (y/n):**

     Specify `y` to generate a trusted SSL certificate using Let's Encrypt. You will be prompted to enter an email address for expiration reminders from Let's Encrypt. For more information, see [Certificate Options]({% link _articles/hosting/certificates.md %}).

     Alternatively, specify `n` and use the **Do you have a SSL certificate to use?** option.

   - **Enter your installation id:**

     Retrieve an installation id using a valid email at [https://bitwarden.com/host](https://bitwarden.com/host). For more information, see [What are my installation id and installation key used for?](https://bitwarden.com/help/article/hosting-faqs/#general).
   - **Enter your installation key:**

     Retrieve an installation key using a valid email at [https://bitwarden.com/host](https://bitwarden.com/host). For more information, see [What are my installation id and installation key used for?](https://bitwarden.com/help/article/hosting-faqs/#general).
   - **Do you have a SSL certificate to use? (y/n):**

     If you already have your own SSL certificate, specify `y` and place the necessary files in the `.bwdata/ssl/your.domain` directory. You will be asked whether it is a trusted SSL certificate (y/n). For more information, see [Certificate Options]({% link _articles/hosting/certificates.md %}).

     Alternatively, specify `n` and use the **self-signed SSL certificate?** option, which is only recommended for testing purposes.
   - **Do you want to generate a self-signed SSL certificate? (y/n):**

     Specify `y` to have Bitwarden generate a self-signed certificate for you. This option is only recommended for testing. For more information, see [Certificate Options]({% link _articles/hosting/certificates.md %}).

     If you specify `n`, your instance will not use an SSL certificate and you will be required to front your installation with a HTTPS proxy, or else Bitwarden applications will not function properly.

### Configure your Environment

Configuring your environment involves two procedures; Installation Configuration and Environment Variable Configuration. The degree to which you will be required to configure your environment will depend on your unique needs.

#### Installation Configuration

The Bitwarden installation script uses settings in `./bwdata/config.yml` to generate the necessary assets for installation. Some installation scenarios (e.g. installations behind a proxy with alternate ports) may require adjustments to `config.yml` that were not provided during standard installation.

Edit `config.yml` as necessary, and apply changes using one of the following commands:

{% icon fa-linux %} {% icon fa-apple %} Bash

    ./bitwarden.sh rebuild

{% icon fa-windows %} PowerShell

    .\bitwarden.ps1 -rebuild

#### Environment Variables

Some features of Bitwarden are not configured by the `bitwarden.sh` installer. Configure these settings by editing the environment file, located at `./bwdata/env/global.override.env`.

**At a minimum, you should replace the values for:**

```
...
globalSettings__mail__smtp__host=<placeholder>
globalSettings__mail__smtp__port=<placeholder>
globalSettings__mail__smtp__ssl=<placeholder>
globalSettings__mail__smtp__username=<placeholder>
globalSettings__mail__smtp__password=<placeholder>
...
adminSettings__admins=
```

Replacing `globalSettings__mail__smtp...=` placeholders will configure the SMTP Mail Server settings that will be used to verify new users and send invitations.

Adding an email address to `adminSettings__admins=` will provision access to the Admin Portal.

After editing `global.override.env`, run one of the following commands to apply your changes:

{% icon fa-linux %} {% icon fa-apple %} Bash

    ./bitwarden.sh restart

{% icon fa-windows %} PowerShell

    .\bitwarden.ps1 -restart

For more information about configuring Environment Variables, see [Configure Environment Variables]({% link _articles/hosting/environment-variables.md %}).

### Start Bitwarden

Once you've completed all previous steps, start your Bitwarden instance:

{% icon fa-linux %} {% icon fa-apple %} Bash

    ./bitwarden.sh start

{% icon fa-windows %} PowerShell

    .\bitwarden.ps1 -start


{% callout info %}
The first time you start Bitwarden it may take some time as it downloads all of the images from Docker Hub.
{% endcallout %}

Verify that all containers are running correctly:

```
docker ps
```

{% image hosting/docker-healthy.png %}

Congratulations! Bitwarden is now up and running at `https://your.domain.com`. Visit the web vault in your web browser to confirm that it's working.

You may now register a new account and log in. You will need to have configured `smtp` environment variables (see [Environment Variables](#environment-variable)) in order to verify the email for your new account.

## Script Commands Reference
