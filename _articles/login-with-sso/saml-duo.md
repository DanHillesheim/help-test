This article contains **Duo-specific** help for configuring Login with SSO via SAML 2.0 For help configuring Login with SSO for another IdP, refer to [SAML 2.0 Configuration]({{site.baseurl}}/article/configure-sso-saml/).

Configuration involves working simultaneously between the Bitwarden [Business Portal]({{site.baseurl}}/article/about-business-portal/) and the Duo Admin Portal. As you proceed, we recommend having both readily available and completing steps in the order they're documented.

{% callout success %}
This article assumes that you have already set up Duo with an Identity Provider. If you haven't, see [Duo's documentation](https://duo.com/docs/sso#saml){:target="\_blank"} for details.
{% endcallout %}

## Open the Business Portal

If you're coming straight from [SAML 2.0 Configuration]({{site.baseurl}}/article/sso-configure-saml/), you should already have an [Organization ID created](https://bitwarden.com/help/article/configure-sso-saml/#step-1-enabling-login-with-sso) and the SSO Configuration screen open. If you don't, open your [Business Portal]({{site.baseurl}}/article/about-business-portal/) and navigate to the SSO Configuration screen:

You don't need to edit anything on this screen yet, but keep it open for easy reference.

## Protect an Application

In the Duo Admin Portal, navigate to the **Applications** screen and select the **Protect an Application** button:

{% image sso/cheatsheets/saml-duo/duo-addapp.png Protect an Application %}

In the search bar, type `generic service provider` and select **Generic Service Provider (Single Sign-On)**:

Complete the following steps and configurations on the Application configuration screen, some of which you'll need to retrieve from the Bitwarden Business Portal:

### Metadata

You don't need to edit anything in the **Metadata** section (*see the above screenshot*), but you'll need to [reference these values later](#identity-provider-configuration).

### Downloads

Select the **Download certificate** button to download your X.509 Certificate, as you'll need to use it [later in the configuration](#identity-provider).

### Service Provider

|Field|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|Entity ID|Set this field to the pre-generated **SP Entity ID** retrieved from the Bitwarden SSO configuration screen.<br><br>For Cloud-hosted customers, this is always `https://sso.bitwarden.com/saml2`. For self-hosted instances, this is determined by your [configured server URL]({{site.baseurl}}/article/install-on-premise/#configure-your-domain), for example `https://your.domain.com/sso.saml2`.|
|Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL|Set this field to the pre-generated **Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL** retrieved from the Bitwarden SSO Configuration screen.<br><br>For Cloud-hosted customers, this is always `https://sso.bitwarden.com/saml2/your-org-id/Acs`. For self-hosted instances, this is determined by your [configured server URL]({{site.baseurl}}/article/install-on-premise/#configure-your-domain), for example `https://your.domain.com/sso/saml2/your-org-id/Acs`.|
|Service Provider Login URL|Set this field to the login URL from which users will access Bitwarden.<br><br>For Cloud-hosted customers, this is always `https://vault.bitwarden.com/#/sso`. For self-hosted instances, this is determined by your [configured server URL]({{site.baseurl}}/article/install-on-premise/#configure-your-domain), for example `https://your.domain.com/#/sso`.|

### SAML Response

|Field|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|NameID format|Set this field to the [SAML NameID format](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19316-01/820-3886/ggwbz/index.html){:target="\_blank"} for Duo to send in SAML responses.|
|NameID attribute|Set this field to the Duo attribute that will populate the NameID in responses.|
|Signature algorithm|Set this field to the encryption algorithm to use for SAML assertions and responses.|
|Signing options|Select whether to **Sign response**, **Sign assertion**, or both.|
|Map attributes|Use these fields to map IdP attributes to SAML response attributes. Regardless of which NameID attribute you configured, map the IdP `Email Address` attribute to `Email`, as in the following screenshot:|

{% image sso/cheatsheets/saml-duo/duo-mapping.png Required Attribute Mapping %}

Once you've finished configuring these fields, **Save** your changes.

## Back to the Business Portal

At this point, youâ€™ve configured everything you need within the context of the DUO Portal. Jump back over to the Bitwarden Business Portal to complete configuration.

The Business Portal separates configuration into two sections:

- **SAML Service Provider Configuration** will determine the format of SAML requests.
- **SAML Identity Provider Configuration** will determine the format to expect for SAML responses.

### Service Provider Configuration

Configure the following fields according to the choices selected in the Duo Admin Portal [during application setup](#protect-an-application):

|Field|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|Name ID Format|[NameID Format](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19316-01/820-3886/ggvxx/index.html){:target="\_blank"} to use in the SAML request (`NameIDPolicy`). Set this field to [the selected NameID format](#saml-response).|
|Outbound Signing Algorithm|Algorithm used to sign SAML requests, by default `rsa-sha256`.|
|Signing Behavior|Whether/when SAML requests will be signed. By default, Duo will not require requests to be signed.|
|Minimum Incoming Signing Algorithm|The minimum signing algorithm Bitwarden will accept in SAML responses. By default, Duo will sign with `rsa-sha256`, so choose that option from the dropdown unless you've [selected a different option](#saml-response).|
|Want Assertions Signed|Whether Bitwarden wants SAML assertions signed. Check this box if you [selected the **Sign assertion** signing option](#saml-response).|
|Validate Certificates|Check this box when using trusted and valid certificates from your IdP through a trusted CA. Self-signed certificates may fail unless proper trust chains are configured within the Bitwarden Login with SSO docker image.|

When you're done with the Service Provider Configuration section, **Save** your work.

### Identity Provider Configuration

Identity Provider Configuration will often require you to refer back to the Duo Admin Portal to retrieve application values:

|Field|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|Entity ID|Enter the **Entity ID** value of your Duo application, which can be retrieved from the Duo app [Metadata section](#metadata).|
|Binding Type|Set this field to **HTTP Post**.|
|Single Sign On Service URL|Enter the **Single Sign-On URL** value of your Duo application, which can be retrieved from the Duo app [Metadata section](#metadata).|
|Single Log Out Service URL|Login with SSO currently **does not** support SLO. This option is planned for future development, however you may pre-configure with the **Single Log-Out URL** value of your Duo application.|
|Artifact Resolution Service URL|For Duo implementations, you can leave this field blank.|
|X509 Public Certificate|Paste the downloaded [Certificate](#downloads), removing `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----` and `-----END CERTIFICATE-----`.<br><br>Extra spaces, carriage returns, and other extraneous characters **will cause certifiation validation to fail**.|
|Outbound Signing Algorithm|Set this field to the [selected SAML Response signature algorithm](#saml-response).|
|Allow Unsolicited Authentication Response|Login with SSO currently **does not** support unsolicited (IdP-Initiated) SAML assertions. This option is planned for future development.|
|Disable Outbound Logout Requests|Login with SSO currently **does not** support SLO. This option is planned for future development.|
|Want Authentication Requests Signed|Whether Duo expects SAML requests to be signed.|

When you're done with the Identity Provider Configuration section, **Save** your work.

## Test the Configuration

Once your configuration is complete, test it by navigating to [https://vault.bitwarden.com](https://vault.bitwarden.com){:target="\_blank"} and selecting the **Enterprise Single Sign-On** button:

{% image sso/sso-button-lg.png Enterprise Single Sign-On button %}

Enter the [configured Organiztion Identifier](#) and select **Log In**. If your implementation is successfully configured, you'll be redirected to your source IdP's login screen.

After you authenticate with your IdP login and Duo Two-factor, enter your Bitwarden Master Password to decrypt your Vault!
