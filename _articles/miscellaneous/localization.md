## Change App Language

In the [Web Vault](https://vault.bitwarden.com){:target="\_blank"} and Desktop App, Bitwarden will default to American English. You can manually change the language by navigating to **Settings** &rarr; **Options** and selecting your language from the **Language** dropdown.

Bitwarden Browser Extensions will dynamically change to use the language set by your Web Browser.

Bitwarden Mobile Apps will dynamically change use the language set by your Operating System.

### Don't See Your Language?

If your language isn't listed in the Web Vault or Desktop App, or if your Browser Extension or Mobile App isn't dynamically using your language, **we want your help!**
