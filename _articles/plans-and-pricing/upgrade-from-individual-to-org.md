This article will guide existing individual Bitwarden users ([**Free**](https://bitwarden.com/help/article/about-bitwarden-plans/#free-individual) or [**Premium**](https://bitwarden.com/help/article/about-bitwarden-plans/#premium-individual)) through the process of transitioning to an Organizations plan ([**Free**](https://bitwarden.com/help/article/about-bitwarden-plans/#free-organizations), [**Families**](https://bitwarden.com/help/article/about-bitwarden-plans/#families-organizations), [**Teams**](https://bitwarden.com/help/article/about-bitwarden-plans/#teams-organizations), or [**Enterprise**](https://bitwarden.com/help/article/about-bitwarden-plans/#enterprise-organizations)) in order to start securely sharing data from Organizations with friends, family, co-workers, a department, or an entire company.

## Start Your Organization

Complete the following steps to start your Organization:

1. Log in to your [Web Vault](https://vault.bitwarden.com/){:target="\_blank"}.
2. Select the **New Organization** button.

   {%image /organizations/new-org-button-overlay.png Select New Organization %}

3. On the New Organization screen, enter an **Organization Name** for your new Organization and the **Billing Email** we can reach you at.

   {% callout info %}Paid Organizations (Families, Teams, or Enterprise) have a 7 Day Free Trial built in. We won't charge you until your trial is over. You can cancel your subscription at any time in the **Settings** tab of your Organization.
   {% endcallout %}

4. If you're creating an Organization on behalf of a business:
   - Check the **This account is owned by a business** checkbox.
   - Provide your **Business Name**.

   Checking the **This account is owned by a business** checkbox will automatically filter your plan options to those suited to businesses. If you represent a business interested in testing secure sharing using a Free Organization, leave this option unchecked.
5. In the **Choose Your Plan** section, select which type of Organization to create. Options include:
   - **Free:** For testing or personal users to share with 1 other user. **[Learn more](https://bitwarden.com/help/article/about-bitwarden-plans/#free-organizations)**.
   - **Families:** For personal use, to share with family & friends. **[Learn more](https://bitwarden.com/help/article/about-bitwarden-plans/#families-organizations)**.
   - **Teams:** For businesses and other team organizations. **[Learn more](https://bitwarden.com/help/article/about-bitwarden-plans/#teams-organizations)**.
   - **Enterprise:** For businesses and other large organizations. **[Learn more](https://bitwarden.com/help/article/about-bitwarden-plans/#enterprise-organizations)**.

   {% callout info %}Paid Organizations (Families, Teams, or Enterprise) include premium features for all enrolled users. For more information about Premium features, see [About Bitwarden Plans](https://bitwarden.com/help/article/about-bitwarden-plans/#compare-the-plans/).
   {% endcallout %}
6. If you selected a Paid Organization, enter the following information:
   - For **Teams** or **Enterprise**, enter the number of **User Seats** you need. You can add additional seats later if required.
   - For **Families**, **Teams**, or **Enterprise**, enter the amount of **Additional Storage (GB)** you need. You plan comes with 1 GB of shared encrypted file attachments, and you can add additional storage later if needed.
   - For **Teams** or **Enterprise**, select whether you'd like to be billed **Annually** or **Monthly**. Families Organizations may only be billed annually.
   - For any Paid Organization, enter your **Payment Information**
7. Click **Submit** to start using your new Organization.

## Cancel Premium Individual Plan

Paid Organizations (Families, Teams, or Enterprise) automatically provide all users with access to premium features. If you had a Premium Individual subscription at the time of creating the Organization, you can cancel your Premium Individual subscription without losing access to premium features.

{% callout warning %}
Bitwarden offers refunds for cancelled Premium Individual plans **within 30 days of account creation**. If you create a paid Organization within 30 days of creating a Premium individual account, [Contact Us](https://bitwarden.com/contact) to initiation your refund.

At this time, Bitwarden does not offer refunds to paid subscriptions older than 30 days.
{% endcallout %}

Complete the following steps to cancel your Premium Individual subscription:

1. Log in to your [Web Vault](https://vault.bitwarden.com/).
2. Open the **Settings** tab and select **Premium Membership** from the left menu.
3. Select the **Cancel Subscription** button.
