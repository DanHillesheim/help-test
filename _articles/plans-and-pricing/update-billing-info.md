Your billing information can only be updated from the [Bitwarden Web Vault](https://vault.bitwarden.com).

{% callout warning %}
Subscriptions to individual plans and Organizations plans are **separate**; you will need to update your billing information in separate areas. If you have **both** Premium and Organizations subscriptions, updating billing information for one will not update the other.
