In continuing our mission to empower individuals and organizations to store and share sensitive data easily and securely, we've recently made some upgrades to our offerings. **This article is for users who created their Bitwarden accounts prior to September 06, 2020 and want to understand the difference between Classic 2019 and current plans.**

To upgrade from your Classic 2019 plan to a current plan, [Contact Us](https://bitwarden.com/contact/) and select **Upgrade/Change Plan** from the **Subject** dropdown menu.

You **will not** be moved to a current plan automatically, and are **not required** to move to a current plan. If you elect to keep your Classic 2019 plan, there will be no change to your feature offering or price.

## Free Individual

There have been no changes made to the **Free** plan for individual users. For more information on what this plan includes, see [About Bitwarden Plans](https://bitwarden.com/help/article/about-bitwarden-plans/).

## Premium Individual

There have been no changes made to the **Premium** plan for individual users. For more information on what this plan includes, see [About Bitwarden Plans](https://bitwarden.com/help/article/about-bitwarden-plans/).

## Families Organizations

Upgrading from Classic 2019 to the current Families Organizations plan will increase your number of users from 5 to 6. With the current plan, all 6 members of your Families Organization will automatically get all premium features, including advanced 2FA options, the Bitwarden Authenticator (TOTP), encrypted file attachments, and more.

We've also reduced the price of a Families Organization to $40/year (*compared to $52/year for a Families Organization and Premium Features for all users*).

Additionally, all members of your Teams Organization will receive access to all premium features for their personal Vaults, including advanced 2FA options, the Bitwarden Authenticator (TOTP), encrypted file attachments, and more.

There is no longer a minimum number of users required for a Teams Organization (*compared to 5 users min. for Classic 2019*). The improved Teams Organizations plan is $3 Per User Per Month (PUPM) (*compared to $2 PUPM for Classic 2019*).

## Enterprise Organizations

Upgrading from Classic 2019 to the current Enterprise plan unlocks the highly anticipated Login with SSO feature-set, simplifying access for enterprise users by fully integrating with your existing Identity Management solution. It also unlocks [Admin Password Reset]({{site.baseurl}}/article/admin-reset/), allowing designated administrators to recover Enterprise Organization user accounts and restore access in the event that an employee forgets their Master Password. 

As before, all members of your Enterprise Organization will automatically get all premium features, including advanced 2FA options, the Bitwarden Authenticator (TOTP), encrypted file attachments, and more.

As before, there is no limit to the number of users in your Enterprise Organization. The current Enterprise Organizations plan is $5 Per User Per Month (*compared to $3 PUPM for Classic 2019 plan*).

## FAQs About Changes

#### Q: When did these changes go into effect?

**A:** These changes went into effect on September 06, 2020. If you created your Bitwarden account before that date and have not yet upgraded, you are on a Classic 2019 plan.

#### Q: How do I upgrade from Classic 2019 to a current plan?

**A:** [Contact Us](https://bitwarden.com/contact/) and select **Upgrade/Change Plan** from the **Subject** dropdown menu. Once you change your plan, your new pricing structure will be reflected on future invoices.

#### Q: If I want to stay on my Classic 2019 plan, do I need to do anything?

**A:** No. Your plan will stay as it is unless you take action to upgrade.

#### Q: If I stay on my Classic 2019 plan, will my pricing change?

**A:** No. Your pricing will only change if you opt-in to upgrading to the current plans.

#### Q: Can I purchase a Families Organization without Premium features?

**A:** If you created your Families Organization before September 06, 2020, you can keep your Families (without Premium features) Organization simply by choosing not to upgrade to the current plan. Families Organizations created after September 06, 2020 will always have Premium features included.

#### Q: I have an Enterprise Organization, how do I upgrade my plan so that I can use Login with SSO?

**A:** [Contact Us](https://bitwarden.com/contact/) and select **Upgrade/Change Plan** from the **Subject** dropdown menu. We highly recommend you test Login with SSO by starting a [7 Day Enterprise Free Trial](https://bitwarden.com/help/article/enterprise-free-trial).

#### Q: I would like to test Login with SSO. If I decide I don't need it, can I revert to my Classic 2019 plan?

**A:** Unfortunately, we aren't able to revert you back to a Classic 2019 plan once you've upgraded. We recommend creating a new Organization to start a [7 Day Enterprise Free Trial](https://bitwarden.com/help/article/enterprise-free-trial/) to test Login with SSO outside of your Primary Organization.
